Instead of India being a common economy, we are a patchwork of dozens of economies making growth slow, business impossible and corruption high.\n"
"\t\tThis problem has been recognized by the developed
            economies and all the progressive ones - Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Japan - have moved to a common GST (Goods and Service Tax) to provide a one common window for tax collection. With just one place of collecting taxes, there won\'t be much delays and corruption. When delays and corruption reduce, economy prospers. The single place for tax collection will drastically improve amount of revenues collected [since it will be much easier to verify who didn\'t pay] and at the same time help businesses grow. Win-Win."

"\t\tExplained: How India will become a common market with GST\n"
"\t\tSo, who gets to lose? All the babus and police who are in the middle and used to collecting random taxes and bribes from these businesses will lose if the taxes are streamlined. Even some businesses that are built around babu connections will lose as their competitors can grow without much political connections. The middleman is the ultimate power in India - whether it be kiranas blocking retail reforms or blocking GST through a variety of hidden tactics - and given that the consumers are sheep with no voice for themselves reforms will sleep.\n"
"\t\tThe thing is, the issue is so straightforward that all the major political parties agree to it. However, it doesn\'t move. Because, all political parties depend on the middleman. Thus, they all keep making noise about it - with no real action.\n"

        <item formatted="false">"\t\tGoods and services tax was introduced to put an end to multiple taxes like CST, VAT, service tax, sales tax, central sales tax which are levied on different products, starting from the source of manufacturing till it reaches to the end consumer which makes movement of goods and doing business very hard.\n"
"\t\tAt present goods and services are taxed differently and also at many levels but after the GST the goods and services will be treated equally and multiple level taxation will be significantly reduce this will eventual lead to less corruption.\n"
"\t\tGST will reduce complexity in taxation and help businesses. Most of the company don’t want to manufacture goods in India because of complexities in the taxes they eventually try to find some shortcuts and this often leads to more corruption\n\n"

"7.It will give a boost to India which can be as much as 2% increase in growth rate.\n"
"8.The GST Network (GSTN) is designed to capture all transaction details up to invoice level. Hence, you can’t escape the inputs or services used in providing the goods or services. Earlier traders didn’t print the invoices as it helped to reduce some burden on them but now they will not be able to that.\n"
"GST will be monitored by both state and central government officers so there are very little chances of escaping from paying the taxes.\n\n"
"Disadvantages of goods and services tax (GST)\n"
"1.Tax rate for services is very high thus it will drive services cost to a new high which includes telecom, airlines and more just to say it will increase your monthly mobile bills. The proposed 18% is higher than many countries such as China, Singapore, Malaysia etc.\n"
"2.Imported goods will come costly and will be taxed around 6%\n"
"3.Many states mostly manufacturing states will lose a huge share of their revenue and monopoly on taxes of central government will increase.\n"
"4.It could potentially drive up the costs in real estate by up to 8%."</item>

"\t\tIndia is a federal democracy that is one which has clear demarcation of powers, responsibility and revenue collection between the states and the centre in its constitution. For example law and order falls under the state’s jurisdiction while the nation’s defence is the centre’s responsibility. The GST too needs to have clear provisions on what areas the centre and the state are allowed to collect revenue from taxation to prevent an overlapping.\n"

"\t\tThe Central GST or CGST is the areas where the centre has the powers and State GST where the State has taxation capabilities. The IGST or Integrated GST is for movement of goods within the states of the Indian union. This will be collected by the union however will be transferred over to the states. Thus it is essential that if and when the GST comes out it is rolled over in the entire nation simultaneously.\n"
